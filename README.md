Conducted an in-depth analysis of Zomato customer preferences using Python and data visualization tools. Explored restaurant types, customer ratings, voting patterns, and spending behavior to uncover key insights such as the dominance of dining restaurants, rating trends (mostly 3.5â€“4), and online order preferences. Used pandas, seaborn, and matplotlib to perform data manipulation and visualization. Findings supported strategic recommendations for customer engagement and marketing, particularly in online vs offline service optimization.
